    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It allows us to create simplified models of real-world entities in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a car, we don't need to know how the engine works internally. We abstract the car as a high-level concept and focus on its essential behaviors like starting, stopping, and accelerating.\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class, and controlling access to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It provides data hiding and protects the internal state of an object from direct external access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A class representing a bank account may encapsulate the account balance as a private data member. It provides public methods like deposit and withdraw to access and modify the balance while enforcing any necessary validation rules."
